# **Septocode 21**

Hello Everyone!👋

**Septocode 21** is a 21 days programming event for students to develop basic programming skills which will be helpful to them while working in various domains in future while inculcating a habit to code daily.🧑💻

Starting from 13th September, all the contributors will be provided with simple programming questions, **one per day**, which can be written using any programming language such as C/C++/Java/Python or any language of preference and will be submitted **every day**. The contributor has to submit the **code** and the **output** generated through **google forms** which will be accepted after **thorough checking**. 👨‍💻



## Steps to Follow: 🙋

- Check the question of the day in the GitHub repository. (You may download the question or fork the repository)
- Download the test cases file.
- You can then start working on the question.

 ## Submission Guidelines 📘	
- A google form will be shared where the code file and output file is to be submitted on a daily basis.⏲️
- To generate the output file, follow the below instructions in the command prompt:
  - Firstly, make sure that the code and output file are in the same directory.
  - Then from the directory, open command prompt.
  - Type the code shown below in the cmd for the language of your preference.
  
    **i.	For C++/C**

        g++/gcc file.cpp -o file.exe

        file.exe < ip.txt > op.txt

    **ii.	For Java**

        javac file.java 

        file.class < ip.txt > op.txt

    **iii.	For Python**

        python file.py < ip.txt > op.txt
